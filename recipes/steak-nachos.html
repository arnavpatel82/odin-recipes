        <p><strong>Description:</strong>This is one of my all-time favorite party foods. For big games or special events, these nachos should get serious consideration for formulating your snack line-up. I recommend serving this with hot sauce on the side, and lots of beer.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 (1 1/2-pound) skirt steak or flap steak</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground dried chipotle pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons bacon fat</li>

            <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans pinto beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups water or chicken broth, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) bag corn tortilla chips</li>
            <li>12 ounces shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>12 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
            <li>1 avocado - peeled, pitted and diced</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped white onion, or to taste</li>
            <li>2 ripe tomato, chopped, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced</li>
            <li>½ cup sour cream, for topping</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season both sides of steak with salt and pepper. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook steak, turning occasionally, to medium doneness, about 6 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 135 to 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer meat to a bowl to let it rest.</li>
            <li>Pour a splash of water into the skillet; stir to scrape up browned bits and deglaze the pan. Pour this liquid over meat. Allow meat to cool completely.</li>
            <li>When meat is completely cool slice thickly (about 1/2 inch) with the grain, then cut into thinner strips. Dice by cutting into pieces against the grain. Transfer chopped steak back to the bowl; toss with the pan drippings.</li>
            <li>Melt bacon fat over medium heat in a pot. Add onions and a pinch of the salt; cook and stir until softened, 5 or 6 minutes. Stir in oregano. Add pinto beans and water. Bring back to a simmer and cook until onions are soft and sweet, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low.</li>
            <li>Mash the beans with a potato masher to your desired consistency. Add additional liquid, if necessary, to achieve your preferred texture. Add the remaining salt to taste. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place tortilla chips about 2 or 3 deep in a heat proof pan. (You may need more than one pan.) Top chips with spoonfuls of beans and a generous handful of steak pieces. Sprinkle with grated cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and edges start to brown, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Scatter diced ripe avocado, diced onions, diced tomatoes, and diced jalapenos over the top. Drizzle nachos with sour cream and garnish with chopped cilantro.</li>
        </ol>
